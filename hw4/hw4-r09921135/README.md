# HW4 Problem 1: Few-Shot Learning - Prototypical Network
In this problem, you will have to implement the prototypical network and answer some questions in the report.

# HW4 Problem 2: Self-Supervised Pre-training for Image Classification
In this problem, you will have to pre-train your own ResNet50 backbone on Mini-ImageNet via the recently self-supervised learning methods. After that, you need to conduct downstream task (i.e., image classification) with different settings to analyze your pre-trained backbone.
